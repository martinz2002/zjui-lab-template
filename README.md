# ZJU-UIUC Report Template

This is a template for reports (such as lab reports, MP reports) for ECE courses at ZJU-UIUC, Zhejiang University. It is originally designed to fit in the requirement of ECE 385, based on the syllabus of Spring 2020 semester.

## Usage

Put `\usepackage{lab-report}` in the preamble. Write your document like `template.tex` and **compile with XeTeX or LuaTeX** to make `ctex` package working normally. (Sometimes we need to input a couple of Chinese charactersâ€¦ `ctex` makes this possible)

If you do not like `ctex`, simply remove it from `lab-report.cls`.

## Feedback
