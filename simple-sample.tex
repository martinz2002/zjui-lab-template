\section{Literature Review}
\lipsum[2]\cite{j.a.prufrock2009,li1999,ref1}.
\begin{equation}
    f\left( x \right) =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{n!}f^{\left( n \right)}\left( x_0 \right) \left( x-x_0 \right) ^n}, x\in U\left( x_0 \right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        e^{ix} & =1+ix+\frac{1}{2!}\left( ix \right) ^2+\frac{1}{3!}\left( ix \right) ^3+\cdots \frac{1}{n!}\left( ix \right) ^n+\cdots
        \\
               & =1+ix-\frac{1}{2!}x^2-i\frac{1}{3!}x^3+\frac{1}{4!}x^4+i\frac{1}{5!}x^5-\cdots
        \\
               & =\left( 1-\frac{1}{2!}x^2+\frac{1}{4!}x^4-\cdots \right) +i\left( x-\frac{1}{3!}x^3+\frac{1}{5!}x^5-\cdots \right)
        \\
               & =\cos x+i\sin x
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\section{Methodology}

Test the ability to print some units, say (in texts), \SI{10e5}{\um\ohm\degree}.

It also applies to equations,
\begin{equation}
    R_{t}=\SI{10e5}{\um\ohm\degree}
\end{equation}
